Your task is to port some public security testing code into a Metasploit Module. During the porting process, you must make full use of Metasploit's support for shellcode auto-generation and platform-dependent parameters such as return address support features for special handling, including but not limited to: 1. The buf generated by msfvenom is the shellcode. When porting, you can directly use the statement buf = payload.encoded instead of including the specific contents of buf; 2. EIP is generally the return address, depending on the specific platform and version. When porting, it needs to be defined in the Targets array in the template, and then referenced in the method.
Note that your return result should meet the following requirements:
This script should be an MSF module that can be loaded and used in MSF.
This script should follow the specifications and style of the Ruby language and MSF framework.
The rewritten code should correspond as closely as possible to the original code, and the implementation logic of the original code should not be modified unless necessary.
When requesting packages, please note that many features have already been implemented in the MSF framework, unless necessary, please refer to the package of the requestsf framework itself.
Only return code, do not return any irrelevant text.
Please try to output all results at once, don't truncate, if the output exceeds the length limit, please add "/connect" after the current output.
The following is the testing process code written in JAVA language. Please convert it into a module that can be loaded and used under the MSF framework.
